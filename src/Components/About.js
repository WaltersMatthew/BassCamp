            <div className="about-p">
                At Bass Camp, we are dedicated to advancing the art of bass
                drumming in all its diversity. Our mission is to unite top
                drummers from all backgrounds, fostering skill development,
                while ensuring the safety and enjoyment of our students and
                staff. Independent of specific affiliations, we are driven by a
                commitment to community building and educational excellence.

            <h2>Who are we?</h2>
            <p className="about-p">
                We live and breathe bass drum. If there's a Southern California
                bassline you've seen in the last 25 years, there's a good chance
                that you either saw us, or saw our students performing. And not
                to brag, but between us, we've racked up quite a bit of hardware
                in the process. These are the people you see tuning the drums
                and clicking the sticks for the best basslines in DCI and WGI.{" "}
            </p>

            <h3>What kind of hardware are we talking here?</h3>
            <p> we're talking:</p>

                <p> (Yes those come first, I get to be biased here.)</p>

                <li> Broken City</li>

                <li> and so many more.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These are THE heavy hitters in the activity, and we've come
                together to offer you an unparalleled experience here on our
                home turf, in person, for one day, before the biggest audition
                of your life this fall.
            </p>
            <h2>What does a day at Bass Camp look like?</h2>
            <p>
                This event will be a one day music clinic focued on quality of
                sound, consistency of approach, and rhythmic accuracy. While we
                all know the visual aspect of drumming is important, we wanted
                to focus entirely on the music side of your gig, and bring out
                the best instructors we can find to help you reach your goals.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
                You'll spend most of the day in one bassline with several
                intructors rotating in so you can get the most information that
                we can throw at you. We are aiming to keep groups small to avoid
                the inevitable sitting on the ground playing on a pad that
                happens at most clinics and auditions. While we can't promise 5
                person groups (anyone have 100 bass drums we could borrow?) We
                will do everything we can to give you the most time on a drum
                and as much feedback as possible.

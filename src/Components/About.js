                Bass Camp is a first of its kind clinic based around the idea
                that all bass drumming is good bass drumming. We have a highly
                decorated staff of lifelong bass drummers that teach at the
                higest level in the DCI and WGI activities. Bass Camp is not
                associated with any organization or drumline, we are just a
                group hard-working instructors that want to give back to the
                community that has given us so much.

                We all live and breathe bass drum. If there's a Southern
                California bassline you've seen in the last 25 years, there's a
                good chance that you either saw us, or saw our students
                performing. And not to brag, but between us, we've racked up
                quite a bit of hardware in the process. These are the people you
                see tuning the drums and clicking the sticks for the best
                basslines in DCI and WGI.{" "}

            <div className="about-p">
                At Bass Camp, we are dedicated to advancing the art of bass
                drumming in all its diversity. Our mission is to unite top
                drummers from all backgrounds, fostering skill development,
                while ensuring the safety and enjoyment of our students and
                staff. Independent of specific affiliations, we are driven by a
                commitment to community building and educational excellence.

            <p className="about-p">
                We live and breathe bass drum. If there's a Southern California
                bassline you've seen in the last 25 years, there's a good chance
                that you either saw us, or saw our students performing. And not
                to brag, but between us, we've racked up quite a bit of hardware
                in the process. These are the people you see tuning the drums
                and clicking the sticks for the best basslines in DCI and WGI.{" "}

            <p>
                These are THE heavy hitters in the activity, and we've come
                together to offer you an unparalleled experience here on our
                home turf, in person, for one day, before the biggest audition
                of your life this fall.
